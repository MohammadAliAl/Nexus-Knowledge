            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Nexus Knowledge, a platform that connects students and their guardians with qualified tutors
                for home tuition services. By using our services, you agree to comply with these Terms of Service. These
                terms govern your relationship with Nexus Knowledge, including access to and use of our services.</p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Students:</strong> There are no age restrictions for students. Guardians can sign up on behalf of
                minors.</p>
            <p><strong>Tutors:</strong> Tutors must be at least 16 years of age and must provide valid identification
                and qualification proof.</p>

            <h2>3. Information Submission</h2>
            <p>Users are not required to create an account, but both students and tutors must provide necessary
                information (e.g., identity and qualification proof) to use our services. This includes personal
                identification documents such as Aadhar cards and educational certificates.</p>

            <h2>4. Payment and Fees</h2>
            <p><strong>For Guardians/Parents:</strong> Payments are made to Nexus Knowledge through our online payment
                gateway, and the service is postpaid. Guardians are responsible for making timely payments.</p>
            <p><strong>For Tutors:</strong> Tutors are considered employees of Nexus Knowledge and are paid based on
                their work reports. Nexus Knowledge retains the right to adjust payment structures as necessary.</p>

            <h2>5. Termination</h2>
            <p>Nexus Knowledge reserves the right to terminate any tutor's association with the company if they attempt
                to bypass the platform and work directly with students, in violation of our agreement. In such cases,
                legal action may also be taken.</p>

            <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
